## 👋 Hi, I'm [Victor Ikeme](https://cloudikeme.com)

**Senior Cloud Platforms Architect** | Creator of [**Build Platforms Daily**](https://blog.cloudikeme.com) | Certified Platform Engineer (PEU)

I specialize in building **Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)** that streamline software delivery for fast-moving teams. My work blends deep cloud infrastructure expertise with a strong product mindset — helping engineering orgs ship platforms that developers love and actually want to use.

I work at the intersection of:

* 🧱 DevOps and Platform Engineering
* 🧑‍💻 Developer Experience (DevEx)
* 🧭 Cloud-Native Architecture
* 🧩 Platform Product Strategy

My mission is simple: **help teams turn scattered cloud-native tooling into cohesive, secure, and scalable developer platforms.**

## 🚀 What I Do

* 🛠️ **Design and implement Internal Developer Platforms (IDPs)** tailored to team needs, built for scale and usability.
* ☁️ Work across **multi-cloud environments** (AWS, Azure, GCP, OpenShift) and **IaC stacks** (Terraform, OpenTofu, Pulumi).
* 🔁 Use **platform orchestrators** like Humanitec, Kratix, and Qovery to abstract infra and enable self-service.
* 🌐 Build and extend **IDP portals** using Backstage, Port, Red Hat Developer Hub, and Humanitec UI.
* 📦 Advocate for **Platforms-as-Products**, promoting adoption through UX, documentation, feedback loops, and DevEx metrics.
* ✍️ Write hands-on tutorials, platform engineering patterns, and tool deep dives on [**Build Platforms Daily**](https://cloudikeme.com).

✅ Whether you're a recruiter looking for platform talent, a CTO modernizing delivery workflows, or an engineer building your first IDP — I create content and tools to help you succeed.
