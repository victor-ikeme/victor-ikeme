## 👋 Hi, I'm [Victor Ikeme](https://linkedin.com/in/victor-ikeme)

**Observability and SRE | Founder @ [**Build Platforms Daily**](https://buildplatformsdaily.substack.com) | 
Platform Engineering for AI & Data | Kubernetes, OpenTelemetry & SQL | Customer-Obsessed | Podcast Host, Speaker & Writer**

I build platforms and distributed systems with a simple goal: make them reliable for the business, understandable for the team, and straightforward for developers to use. My focus is on removing friction, reducing toil, and ensuring that our infrastructure supports innovation instead of getting in the way.

I have over 5 years of experience across DevOps, Platform and Site Reliability Engineering, working at the intersection of infrastructure, applications, business metrics and the teams that build them. I’m drawn to the challenge of turning complex cloud environments into systems that are observable, maintainable, and truly helpful to the engineers who depend on them.

I specialize in:
- Observability, SRE & Platform Engineering: Transforming complex systems into human-centered developer experiences.
- Technical Storytelling: Translating deep technical depth into resonant narratives.
- Growth Strategy: Designing data-driven campaigns that convert awareness into measurable adoption.

Community is the heart of my work. 

As the Founder and Host of the Build Platforms Daily podcast and newsletter, I explore how leading teams define and measure Developer Experience. 

Through this platform and active participation in CNCF and PlatformEngineering.org communities, I am dedicated to making modern infrastructure not only reliable, scalable and resilient but also understandable and lovable, ultimately impacting business values.

If you are building in the cloud-native ecosystem, I invite you to connect. 

Let's discuss how to turn your platform and product into a story that developers genuinely care about.
